1. Understanding your audience’s expertise level helps you adjust how complex the information is. If they’re tech experts, you can use more technical terms. If not, keep it simple and avoid jargon.


2. Tailoring content: For experts, use technical terms and in-depth details. For non-experts, explain terms simply and use examples.


3. Gauge audience knowledge: Ask questions, look at their background, or start with basic concepts to see how much they understand before diving deeper.


4. Ensure accessibility: Use simple language, avoid jargon, explain terms, and offer examples.


5. Plain language is important because it makes information easier to understand, especially for those who aren’t familiar with technical terms.


6. Simplifying terms: "Start" is clearer than "initiate." It’s easier to understand everyday words than complex ones.


7. Examples and visuals help by showing rather than just telling. They make difficult ideas easier to grasp.


8. Effective visuals: Diagrams work well for showing processes, while charts can simplify data comparisons.


9. Headings and subheadings break content into sections, making it easier to follow and find specific information.


10. Best practices: Use clear, descriptive headings. Keep them short and direct to the point.


11. Readme introduction: Include what the product does, why it’s useful, and how to use it right away.


12. Conveying purpose and features: Use a short sentence explaining the product’s main function, then list key features clearly.
